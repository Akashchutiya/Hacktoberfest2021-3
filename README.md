Open source is changing the world – one contribution at a time.

CHOOSE TREES OR TEES Rather than receive t-shirts as swag, you can choose to have a tree planted in your name and help make Hacktoberfest 2021 more carbon neutral.

GIVING TO OPEN SOURCE Open-source projects keep the internet humming—but they can’t do it without resources. Donate and support their awesome work.
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community! How to participate? You just need to make five contributions to open source before October 31 and can receive a free Hacktoberfest t-shirt.
